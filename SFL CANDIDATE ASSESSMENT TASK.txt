A live, deployed application with: 
●	A Node.js backend 
●	A React frontend 
Both built specifically for this assessment. 
  
Evaluation Criteria 
Your submission will be evaluated across the following seven dimensions: 
Dimensio	Criteria 	What We're Looking For n 
D1 	UI/UX Refinement 	Polish, visual appeal, intuitive interactions, thoughtful design choices, and attention to detail 
D2 	Functional 
Complexity 	Sophistication of features, depth of functionality, and technical ambition achieved 
D3 	Front-End Quality 	Absence of visual bugs, layout issues, broken interactions, or rendering problems 
D4 	Back-End Quality 	Reliability of functionality, data handling, API integrations, and error-free operations 
D5 	Responsiveness 	Seamless adaptation across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes 
D6 	Performance 	Load times, runtime speed, smooth animations, and overall snappiness 
D7 	Overall     Impressiveness	The wow factor, including creativity, usefulness, and memorability 
  
Submission Requirements 
Your final submission must include the following four components: 
S1. Application Description 
Provide a clear description of what your vibecoded application does and why you believe it's impressive. Explain the problem it solves or the value it provides, and highlight the features you're most proud of. 
S2. Prompt Documentation 
Share the key prompts you used to create, refine, and finalize your application. We want insight into your prompting style, thought process, and how you collaborated with AI throughout development. You don’t need to include every minor fix, but we should clearly see your methodology. 
S3. Live Application Link 
Provide the URL where your deployed application is hosted so our team can interact with it directly. Include any relevant instructions, such as demo credentials or workflows to try. 
S4. GitHub Repository Link 
Provide a link to the public GitHub repository containing your application’s source code. 
  
Guidelines and Tips 
●	Freedom of Choice: Build any type of application. Choose something that highlights your strengths and allows you to demonstrate range across the evaluation dimensions. 
●	AI Tools: Use any AI-assisted development tools you prefer (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, v0, Bolt, Replit Agent). Your tool choices are part of the evaluation. 
●	Deployment: Deploy on any platform such as Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Render, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare. 
●	Intentional Scoping: Design and build your app as if you only had two hours of total effort. We are evaluating how well you prioritize, not how long you work. 
●	Quality Over Quantity: A polished, reliable app with limited features will score higher than an ambitious but unstable one. 
  
What Success Looks Like 
Strong submissions typically demonstrate: 
●	A clear vision executed with precision 
●	Thoughtful UI/UX that feels intentional rather than generic 
●	Reliable functionality without obvious bugs 
●	Creative problem-solving in both the app concept and prompting approach 
●	Evidence of smart trade-offs and iteration within a constrained scope
